<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a repository to store CTF challenges to be deployed for `csictf`.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

> Note: This is a beginner CTF, hence the challenges should be of easy / moderate difficulty.
<br />

> Note: DO NOT PLAGIARIZE challenges from other CTFs. You can take inspiration but not have the exact same challenge.

The following are the categories of challenges that are to be made:

- Pwn
- Web
- OSINT
- Linux
- Crypto
- Forensics
- Log Analysis
- Miscellaneous

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/csivitu/ctf-challenges.git
```

## Template

### Flag Format

- The flags must be enclosed in `csictf{}`.
- They can have numbers, alphabets, `_`s, `'`s, `!`s, `.`s, `+`s, `-`s.
- They must be related to the challenge.
- They must not be so simple that you can guess them.

Here's a regex for the flag format.

```
/^csictf{[\w_!\.'"+-]{5,35}}$/
```

Here's a sample flag.

```
csictf{th1s_i5_4_s4mpl3_fl4g'+!-.}
```

### Directory Structure

The following are guidelines for creating challenge folders.

- Each challenge has it's own folder, which is placed in the relevant directory amongst the ones enlisted above.
- Each challenge **must** have a `README.md` file describing how to solve the challenge, along with the relevant code / files that needs to be run / deployed on the server.
- The flag must be present in the `README.md` for the challenge.
- We prefer having each challenge in it's own docker container, so that it's simple to deploy.

```
- pwn/
  - n00binary/
    - README.md
    - n00binary
    - n00binary.c
    - Dockerfile
- web/
  - localize/
    - README.md
    - localize.php
```

### Template for Challenge README

As mentioned earlier, each challenge requires a `README`. This should have the following format.

```
# Challenge Name

## Description

Brief Description about challenge

## Requirements

- Docker: [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)

## Sources

- [sample.py](./sample.py)
- [sample.txt](./sample.txt)

## Exploit

<!-- Much more detailed description than the following. -->
Reverse `sample.py` to decrypt the flag in `sample.txt.`
```

> Refer to this [sample](https://github.com/csivitu/CTF-Write-ups/tree/master/HSCTF%207/Binary%20Exploitation/boredom#exploitation) for writing the exploit section.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
