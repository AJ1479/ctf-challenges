## Exploit

CK227 is the China Cargo Airlines flight from Shanghai to Anchorage, and I write real good is a Twitter handle (iwriterealgood). Jack Dorsey here is a reference to using Twitter and another Jack (Jack Ma) whose first tweet was about sending masks on this flight CK227. If you search CK227 on Twitter, you find a tweet by Sergio Quintana replying to Jack Ma and @iwriterealgood. A look at his bio shows that he works at NBC. 

The flag is:
