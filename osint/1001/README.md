At 25 I started playing the market game,
Now everyone in China knows my name.
A box and Sparrow remind people of my man,
Although some would say he’s closer to Jackie Chan.

The poem is a reference to a famous story. Who wrote the story?

## Exploit

The 25 started playing the market game line refers to entering the stock market or setting up the IPO of a company. Here 25 doesn’t refer to the company’s age when they had their IPO but at their valuation which is $25 (billion). The company is very famous in China, as seen in their second line. The box and Sparrow reminding people of the main is referring to Jack Ma (jack in the box and Jack Sparrow), and the last line refers to his name sounding similar to Jackie. <br />
The picture contains 40 genies, which represents genies and 40 things. Putting these together, we can see that the company is Alibaba and the story we are referring to is Alibaba and 40 thieves. This story was written by Hanna Diyab.
